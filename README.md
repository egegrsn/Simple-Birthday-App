# SimpleBirthdayApp - 3 hours challenge

In this project, I tried to apply MVVM pattern. Firstly, I created most of the necessery files and arrange those files in the project. I prefer to be arranged in the project so it wont be messy. Secondly, I built the model and created a service for rest api. I fetched the results from the api with my model.

After that, I created my ViewModel and passed my model data. In ViewModel, I am applying some logic to my raw Data. After completing my ViewModel, I started to create my controllers and views. This project has built in 3 hours approximately.
